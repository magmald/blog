The Books of Eldrida were compiled from the collection of fragments
from ancient torn tomes and scrolls recovered over the centuries
and then analyzed and translated by the great sages over the centuries.

It is of a different sort than most of the other books in this series.

It is not well organized, and there is no direct connection to the many
myths and legends that make up the cultures of those that inhabit the many
multidimensional landscapes.

It is not innovative or sophisticated,
and it is not well-structured.
It is not well-formed.
