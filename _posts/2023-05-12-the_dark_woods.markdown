Deep within the dark woods the hills rise untamed in a strange continual night. There are valleys filled with thick forests that have never been explored. There are deep, narrow glens with amazing tree slants and thin brooks trickling without ever catching a glimmer of light from the sun.

The druids say the place is filled with strong magic and some go there to discover that. No one who has gone into that eternal dark has ever returned. Still, they go into it and are absorbed. Some say, even their memory is forgotten by those they left behind.
