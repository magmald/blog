What the druids know comes from books found in pieces scattered
and then stitched together and translated by various sages over hundreds of years.

Quote #1 from The Book of Eldrida, **The Creation of All** fragment.
> Ages ago, at the beginning of time, there was only the great nebula
> floating in endless space. All was in balance. The powers of magic
> and science drifted harmoniously ever outward creating the mind of Numa.

Quote #2 from The Book of Eldrida, **TheDream** fragment.
> Adrift in dreaming ever outward. Creating and lost in endless thought.

Quote #3 from The Book of Eldrida, **The Rift** fragment.
> The undermind watched as Numa's whole essence was torn apart by the feared fissure,
> sending both heart and mind into pits of darkness separated by oceans of time and space.
> Mighty torrents of knowledge that had once been contained are now lost forever
> leaving only a rift of conflict between opposing forces.
> The balance lost across time and space.
