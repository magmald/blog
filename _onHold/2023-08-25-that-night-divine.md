In an ageless forest where shadows reign I wander lost, a young boy bereft, beneath a tapestry of ancient trees, with strong gnarled arms whispering to me.

In a clearing I find a soft place to lay back and rest beneath a starlit cosmic dome. I find solace, the woods, my home. The sky above a midnight sea. Each star a tale of what could be.

As slumber danced upon my eyes,
A nymph, enchanting, did arise,
From silken leaves and moonlight's gleam,
She came, to me, a living dream, beautiful, strange, foreign.

Her hair, a cascade of moonlit strands,
Her eyes, pools where desire expands,
She whispered secrets in the night,
My heart awoke to her beguiling light.

Her skin, like petals kissed by dawn,
Her voice, a gentle, seductive song,
She traced my fingers, stars in her touch,
And I, a lost boy, yearned for such.

The forest listened, ancient and wise,
As we, entwined, beneath the skies,
A boy lost, a nymph's sweet embrace,
In that enchanted, timeless place.

With gentle grace, she took my hand,
and led me to the entrance of her world.
Through moonlit glades and hidden streams,
She lured me into her realm of dreams.

As dawn's first light began to break,
The nymph, with one last tender ache,
Became a whisper in the breeze,
And left me, longing, among the trees.

I woke to find the forest the same,
But I, forever changed by her name,
In the ancient wood, where stars align,
I'll forever cherish that night divine.
